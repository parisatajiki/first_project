This is the first project I'm uploading on GitHub, and it's very special and valuable to me.
I know that first attempts are usually not perfect and flawless - this project is no exception, and it definitely has some shortcomings.
But I decided to put it here to document part of my growth and learning journey.
I want to be able to look back at this project in the future and see my progress.
This is both a memory and a starting point for building better things!"
